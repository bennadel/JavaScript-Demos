<h1>
	Replacing ngInclude With Component Directives In AngularJS
</h1>

<p>
	This is the <strong>primary</strong> layout.

	<!-- 
		NOTE: For simplicity of the demo (since we're not using URL-based routing), this
		method is inherited from the app-controller.
	-->
	<a ng-click="showSecondaryLayout()">Show secondary layout</a>
</p>

<!-- 
	From this component (primary layout), we're going to "include" another component
	to look at how nested layouts can be achieved without ngInclude. 
-->
<div friends-list>
	<!-- Content provided by component directive. -->
</div>
